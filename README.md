# App GPT

A GPT-3 Flutter project.

## Introduction

This project is a flutter integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 engine.

GPT-3 models can understand and generate natural language. 
The completions endpoint is at the center of the API. It provides a simple interface to our models that is extremely flexible and powerful. You input some text as a prompt, and the model will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it.

This application has been tested on Android, IOS, MacOS and Web and is completely functional.
